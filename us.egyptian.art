Egyptian Feet|[1]|Egyptian toes, arguably the neatest looking of the 5 shapes, have a long big toe followed by the other toes reducing in size at a 45-degree angle. There’s not much to say about ancient Egypt and the effects of genetic ancestry on foot shape. However, it’s worth noting that there was a culturally homogenous Egyptian population which shared the territory with a variety of other ethnicities from along the Nile, Northern Africa, and the Arabian peninsula.2019_04_26-genetic_counsellingWhat Is Genetic Counselling And Do I Need A Session? Possibly the most interesting (and odd) fact about ancient Egyptian feet is their use of artificial toes on at least one mummy. Researchers at the University of Manchester found evidence of two prosthetic toes, one made from a type of papier-maché and the other from wood and leather. They then decided to trial their own version of these prosthetics on people — of course they did — and found that false toes could help people (lacking a big toe) walk more comfortably in sandals, the traditional footwear of that era.
