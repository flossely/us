Taj Jackson's Poem|[1]|Bullying and name calling are considered mean and not tolerated. Unless it's about Michael Jackson. Making up stories for profit is dishonest and journalists who do so are considered tabloid. Unless it's about Michael Jackson. A movie with as many lies as Leaving Neverland is not called a documentary. Unless it's about Michael Jackson. A rumour should be verified before reported and spread around the world. Unless it's about Michael Jackson. It's wrong to question someone's sexuality. Unless it's about Michael Jackson. You're innocent until proven guilty. Unless you're Michael Jackson. You can rest in peace once you die. Unless you're Michael Jackson.
